**Tagline:** Durable – Functional – Natural

## Overview
Titanium artificial roots anchored into the jawbone. Provide a stable base for crowns, bridges, or dentures. Mimic the strength and appearance of natural teeth. Maintain natural face shape and improve chewing/speaking ability.

## Key Benefits
- **Superior Materials** — titanium; biocompatible and fuses with bone (osseointegration)
- **Stability** — secure anchor vs. dentures that shift or require adhesives
- **Versatility** — single tooth, multiple teeth, or full mouth reconstruction; can enhance denture stability
- **Bone Health Preservation** — stimulates and maintains jawbone; prevents bone deterioration from tooth loss

## Jaw Repair
Specializes in reconstructing compromised jaw structure (from injury, disease, or prolonged tooth loss). State-of-the-art techniques and materials enhance implant success rate and restore natural alignment and functionality.

## PRGF Technology (Plasma Rich in Growth Factors)
Uses patient's own blood to enhance healing and regeneration.
- **Safe & Natural** — no risk of disease transmission or rejection
- **Accelerated Healing** — reduces recovery time
- **Enhanced Bone Growth** — increases predictability and speed of new bone formation
- **Reduced Inflammation** — less swelling and discomfort during recovery

## All-on-4™ Implant Supported Dentures
Permanent full-arch tooth replacement using just **4 titanium posts**. Ideal for patients with limited bone density.

### Key Benefits
- **Permanent Solution** — fixed set that feels and functions like natural teeth
- **Quick Recovery** — faster healing vs. traditional implants
- **Cost-Effective** — more economical than replacing each tooth individually
- **Minimal Bone Grafting** — often eliminates need for grafts
- **Bone Preservation** — prevents jawbone deterioration

### Procedure
1. Four titanium posts precisely placed in the jaw
2. Temporary dentures fitted same day
3. Over 3–6 months, implants bond with bone
4. Permanent denture set replaces temporaries

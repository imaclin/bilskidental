## What Is a Gum Lift?
A precise cosmetic dental procedure that sculpts gum tissue around teeth. Also called gingivectomy or gum contouring. Addresses uneven gum lines, minimizes excessive gum visibility when smiling, and exposes more of the teeth for better proportion and aesthetics. Also improves gum health by removing overhanging areas where bacteria accumulate, reducing periodontal risk.

## Benefits

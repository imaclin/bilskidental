## What Are Dental Crowns?
Tooth-shaped "caps" fitted snugly over a tooth to restore its size, shape, strength, and appearance. Encases the visible portion above the gum line. Materials: porcelain, ceramic, or metal alloys — matched to natural teeth color.

## When to Consider a Crown
- Weak teeth vulnerable to decay
- Teeth at risk of breaking or already broken
- Severely worn-down teeth
- Large fillings requiring coverage
- Misshapen or discolored teeth needing aesthetic improvement
- Teeth restored after a root canal

## Benefits
- **Improves Appearance** — covers discolored or misshapen teeth
- **Restorative Function** — supports dental bridges; holds fillings in place
- **Protection** — shields weak or cracked teeth from further damage
- **Strength & Restoration** — restores natural shape, size, and function

## Procedure (Step-by-Step)
1. **Initial Examination** — thorough evaluation with X-rays; assesses root and surrounding bone
2. **Tooth Preparation** — tooth numbed and reshaped; impression taken; temporary crown placed
3. **Fitting & Fine-tuning** — permanent crown fitted; adjusted for perfect bite and comfort

## What Is a Root Canal?
Treatment for infections within the tooth pulp (innermost part containing nerves and blood vessels). Causes: deep decay, cracks, or chips allowing bacteria to penetrate. Process: remove infected pulp → clean canal system → seal tooth.

## Why Choose Root Canal Therapy
- **Infection Removal** — eliminates infected pulp, often caused by deep decay
- **Tooth Preservation** — saves the natural tooth, avoids extraction
- **Comfortable Procedure** — performed under local anesthesia; pain-free experience
- **Prevents Spread** — stops infection from reaching neighboring teeth or gums
- **Restores Oral Health** — leads to healthier smile and overall well-being

## Warning: Untreated Infections
Untreated tooth infections can lead to abscesses, severe pain, bone damage, and potentially life-threatening complications.

## Common Questions
- **Causes:** Tooth decay or fractures allowing bacteria to infect the pulp
- **Is it necessary?** Yes — untreated infections risk abscess, bone damage, and serious health issues
- **Symptoms:** Temperature sensitivity, swelling/pain, bad taste; note — symptoms are sometimes absent

## Sedation Options
- **Oral sedation** — pill-based for ease and comfort
- **IV conscious sedation** — deeper sedation, rapid onset, amnesic effects
- **Local anesthesia** — targeted numbness for specific treatments
